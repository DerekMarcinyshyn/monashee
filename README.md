# Monashee Mountain Multimedia

## Moved from WordPress to Jekyll

It was time for another change. This is my 8th version of Monashee Mountain Multimedia. I enjoy experimenting with different web technologies with my own sites before deploying them to clients sites.

## Features

* Built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
* Built with Twitter Bootstrap
* Super simple flat Html5 files
* Minified and compressed html, css, js
