<h1>Web Development</h1>

<p>I have been coding on computers dating back to when I attended the University of Manitoba from 1987 to 1991. I wrote my first code in 1982 on a Commodore VIC 20. Back then I would run to the store to buy a Compute magazine that had video games in it and you could input and tweak yourself.</p>

<p>I have a personal website at <a href="http://derek.marcinyshyn.com" target="_blank">Derek.Marcinyshyn.com</a>.</p>
