<h1>Web Development</h1>

<p>Monashee Mountain Multimedia builds software. We specialize in Magento and WordPress custom web applications. MMM also creates custom digital signage solutions such as digital cinema pre-shows and custom digital advertising solutions.</p>

<p>Derek has been coding on computers dating back to when he attended the University of Manitoba from 1987 to 1991. He wrote his first code in 1982 on a Commodore VIC 20. After school he would run to the store to buy the latest Compute magazine that had video games in it where you could input and tweak yourself the games.</p>

<h2>Web Hosting</h2>

<p><a href="https://revelstokewebhosting.com" target="_blank">Revelstoke Web Hosting</a> is geared towards high traffic sites and web site owners that want fast page load times. The servers are located on the Peer 1 network based in Vancouver, BC. RWH uses the Litespeed web server which is up to 6x faster than Apache web server. All accounts use Varnish reverse proxy engine to dramatically speed up your page loads.
</p>

<p>We serve static site assets from a content delivery network such as Amazon CloudFront. This site uses <a href="http://www.netdna.com/" target="_blank">Net DNA</a> for some of the Twitter Bootstrap assets.
</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<p>Similar to others that work on the web stack, we find ourselves in PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and javascript. However, we do play in Ruby, Python, ActionScript, C# and other interesting languages.</p>

<p>We also find the time to experiment in After Effects and cameras.</p>
