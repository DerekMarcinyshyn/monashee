<!--p>Derek has been coding on computers dating back to when he attended the University of Manitoba from 1987 to 1991. Derek wrote his first programs in 1982 on a Commodore VIC 20. Back then, after school he would ride his BMX to the store to buy the latest Compute magazine which had video games code in it and he would input and tweak the code to build video games.
