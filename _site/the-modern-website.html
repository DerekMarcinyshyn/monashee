The idea of building businesses not websites, had not been invented yet. Early websites read like Corporate Annual Reports, event flyers or greeting cards. It was a passive system. Essentially, they were “brochure” websites that just displayed information. Unfortunately, these type of websites still have not gone away and are still being promoted by commercials, corporate agencies and automatic systems offering you a website for free or downright cheap. These websites are a detriment to your business. What we have ended up with is an “off-the-shelf-disposable” mentality with business websites. Pick your category, pick your template and you are ready to go. This DOES NOT work and never did!</p><p>In the early 2000′s things got a little better with the introduction of “Web Logs” or as we know them today, “Blogs.” When blogs came on the scene they created a new path for websites to communicate to visitors and changed the dynamic to a “push” system. Several blogging software platforms later added the ability to comment and at that point, websites truly became interactive.</p><p>Fast forward to the present and websites are now immersible. Virtual ecosystems themselves with methodical planning, strategy and tracking. Content consisting of pictures, video and articles are traded and shared like currency. Websites are now replacing storefronts and offices, to become sole destinations. Access via smartphones and tablets have made websites more essential and the content efficient. What’s happened with websites is what isn’t happening with apps, they are more broadly distributed, easier to maintain and easier to use.</p><p>Websites that are built today have a longer shelf life. Well thought out websites are under constant evaluation. Content is added daily, traffic is monitored and modifications are made. Every action has purpose to make the experience easier for the visitor. Getting them to the information they need as efficiently as possible. With this kind of attention, comes a lot more work. It’s a full time job. The added work comes with an incredible payoff, because the results are exponential. With these great rewards the importance of the website has changed from being a part of your business to being your business.</p><h2 id='your_website_is_your_business'>Your Website is your Business</h2><p>New service that claim to take over the website appear all the time. <a href='http://facebook.com/'>Facebook</a>, <a href='http://twitter.com/'>Twitter</a>, <a href='http://linkedin.com/'>LinkedIn</a>and <a href='http://www.google.com/'>Google</a>, are the current crop, but they are designed as peripheral communication services. You still can’t customize the look and feel, buy anything or even fill out a form that goes directly to you. Websites are hyper custom. You decide where everything goes. Your customers and clients get this innate familiarity when visiting, because it reiterates how you speak about your business. Your website truly reflects your business, how you run your business and is your business.</p><p>The reason this is important is not because you should stop operating a brick and mortar business or close your office, it’s because it’s about running a sustainable business that communicates with its customers. They want to hear from you. You have received a prized gift from them, their trust and patronage, and you are obligated to give them more. Your website is that conduit for how your customers can receive and send information. Your website is where you can organize the message, dictate and guide the information to your customers. If your website is static, inactive or neglected, it’s like not showing up. You are missing the opportunity to share the information with a particular customer, how you like to share it, in the context you like it to be shared.</p><p>So, websites have evolved from a static system, to a push system and now to an interactive system. It has evolved to become your core business tool.</p><h2 id='the_digital_hub_as_a_tool'>The Digital Hub as a Tool</h2><p>It’s not just a website. Can we even call it that anymore? What most of us identify as a website, is fairly dated. The flow of information going in and out of a website today is extensive. Our expectations for what a website is supposed to do and should do has evolved. Should not we call it a “Digital Hub?” Now, not all websites can be called Digital Hubs. The software that runs those sites have to have incredible capabilities. <a href='http://wordpress.org/'>WordPress</a> is one such tool and that’s what I use to build websites. WordPress excels at easily integrating third party peripheral services. There is no other tool as extensive and capable as WordPress is today.</p><p>A “Hub” is often described as a transfer point. A place where you can start at or stop at on your way to somewhere else. The website of today really epitomizes this idea. There are so many wonderful peripheral services that either guide people to your site or get sent there from your site. These peripheral services are usually tied to sharing, receiving feedback, informing and educating. It’s what Social Media is all about. Social Media is an extension of your site. Another tool in your arsenal. Social Media is about reach.</p><p><strong>HUB THOUGHTFUL CONTENT SOCIAL MEDIA = HYPER EXPOSURE</strong></p><p>Social Media has enabled businesses to grow beyond their expected borders. That corner shop does not need to necessarily be on the corner in a prime foot traffic location anymore. Some businesses are finding that they don’t need a physical location at all. This is new, because many of us are not used to not being face to face with our customers. We are unfamiliar with the idea of not shaking someone’s hand, having small talk and giving a smile. That small amount of information is our feedback, our data. Have you ever been asked, “Did you find everything okay?” Without those answers, how will we know if we are doing a good job? How will we communicate with our customers? All of that has been solved. There are new tools for communicating and we have an amazing tool that we have never had access to before – ANALYTICS!</p><h2 id='the_data_will_win'>The Data will Win</h2><p><a href='http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics/all/all'>56% of all websites are using Google Analytics</a> to measure performance. Google Analytics is a free tool by Google that provides you a tremendous amount of data about visitors coming to your website. We now have access to actual numbers that show us, how many visitors came to our site, where they went, what they read, how long they stayed and even how they got there. Those statistics are just the tip of the iceberg, there is so much more data. We can find out what time of the day people come, what type of device they came from and most importantly we can create goals and run reports against those goals.</p><p><a href='http://www.google.com/analytics/customers/index.html'>Googles own Case Studies</a> show us how companies are using this valuable data. We can now find out if our marketing campaigns are paying off by tracking social, email and event outreach. This allows us to put our resources where we know will have the largest impact. Ecommerce and registration can be tracked by setting up goals and funnels that track the path people follow. Any disruptions in that path will be clearly identified and we can make any necessary adjustments. Never before have we had better insight into the health and inner-workings of our business than we do now with analytics.</p><h2 id='putting_it_into_action'>Putting it into Action</h2><p>It’s obvious that positioning your business to operate in this manner does not happen overnight. We have developed some best practices to help you identify the goals of your business and more importantly, create a realistic strategy on how to implement those goals. Everything about how you run your business should be considered, how much time you have, where your current customers come from and how you would like your business to be. Your website should be tailored to how you want your website to be 6 months from now and then a plan needs to be put in place to get you there. Try to identify the bottlenecks in that process and then we can leverage their website in a way to alleviate that bottleneck. Sometimes the solutions are not always that obvious. Often we have to look at the problem in a different way and create a new process. These are the most exciting times, because this is when innovation happens.</p><p>After everything that we’ve covered it’s hard to imagine thinking of a website the same way again. It’s so much more. It’s always evolving, it’s never finished and can truly change peoples lives. Websites are the new core business and more than ever they ARE your business.</p><p>This was first posted here: <a href='http://crowdedsites.com/news/building-businesses-not-websites/'>http://crowdedsites.com/news/building-businesses-not-websites/</a></p></div></div><div class="span3"><div class="well sidebar"><h3>Latest Posts</h3><ul><li><a href="/wordpress-to-jekyll.html">WordPress to Jekyll</a></li><li><a href="/the-modern-website.html">The Modern Website</a></li><li><a href="/how-to-add-htop-to-a-centos-and-ubuntu-server.html">How to Add htop</a></li><li><a href="/speed-matters.html">Speed Matters</a></li><li><a href="/crowdsourcing.html">Crowdsourcing</a></li><li><a href="/fastcgi-data-timeout-error.html">Fastcgi data timeout error</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><hr class="footer-ruler"> <footer><div class="container"><div class="copyright"> © 2006-2013 Monashee Mountain Multimedia.
