This new open-source project from Adobe is called [Brackets] [1]. It still is very early on but it is a great idea for quick front-end developing of web sites. It is completely built from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is hosted on [GitHub] [2]Â and can easily be downloaded and start playing with it right now.
