Monashee Mountain Multimedia has now completed version 8 of its website. We generally start experimenting with new technologies (or at least new to us) and implement them into our site to see how they work.

We migrated from our custom themed WordPress site to a Jekyll driven website. Jekyll is written in the Ruby computer language and is written by one of the co-founders of GitHub. You create a free website easily with this technology.

[Here is the wiki to Jekyll.][1]

We used the [WordPress to Jekyll exporter plugin][2]. It did a great job of exporting the data. We did not have that many posts, categories and tags to convert but reading what others experienced seems like it is possible.

The great thing about Jekyll is written in simple [markdown][3] language and then uploading flat html files. Nothing is faster than simple html files!

For someone who does not need the overhead of WordPress it makes things easier to maintain.
