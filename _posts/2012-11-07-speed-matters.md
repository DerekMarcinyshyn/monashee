It is important if your business website whether it is ecommerce or displaying your products and services, you should make page load times a priority. [Research from Google and Microsoft] [2] show that slower websites convert less and that the effect of a slow website is lasting.

Here at Monashee Mountain Multimedia, we use [Varnish] [3] and [Litespeed webserver] [4] on a Virtual Private Server on the Peer 1 Network. Keeping up with the latest version of PHP, Python, and mySQL on our main server stack while using Redis and APC as well. We also incorporate Amazon CloudFront for our Content Delivery Network which delivers the static content.
