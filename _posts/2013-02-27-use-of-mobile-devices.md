One half of all local searches are performed on mobile devices. 86% of mobile internet users are using their devices while watching TV. At Monashee Mountain Multimedia, we can create and track coupons that can be redeemed instanteously in your store. 29% of mobile users are open to scanning a mobile tag to get coupons. On average, users are found to spend 2.7 hours per day socializing on their mobile device. That's over twice the amount of time they spend eating, and over 1/3 of the time we spend sleeping.
