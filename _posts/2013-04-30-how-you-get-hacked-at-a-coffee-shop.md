Let's face it most of you have no idea how the internet works. I mean that in the nicest way possible, reason being, most people could care less about how many of the things in modern life work. We have busy lives and we just want stuff to work for it to be easy.

So going into a coffee shop and while waiting for your coffee, you figure you would save yourself some cash from your gouging data plan from the big telco you signed the next 3 years of life away to.

You open your Wi-Fi settings on your phone, and there it is INTERNET or FREE-WIFI.

Well, little do you know or have the time to care to read the sign that says our free wi-fi is called REVY COFFEE HOUSE. Meanwhile, you just signed into the classic "man-in-the-middle" scenario where someone in the coffee has set their device as a hotspot and can record all your data going throught their device.

The social experiment. These days you can buy bulk USB drives for 100 for $10. So I'm going to drop a self-executing OS independent app on there that once inserted plants a backdoor to your computer.

What just happened? Well, you thought you would just snoop a little and find out what was on the USB drive, little did you think to run your virus scanner on it. What? A virus scanner but I use a MAC...exactly. Social hacking. 

Hi-res video cameras on phones. Ya, so what? Standing in line flipping your debit card around waiting to pay for it, I am standing behind looking like I am fiddling with Facebook or Twitter, but really recording and zoomed in HD right on your card. Then zoom out a little, pretend to look the other way as you go in to enter your PIN whilst I record everything.

These are a few of the examples that are being played out everyday in the modern world. Everywhere not just the big cities.
