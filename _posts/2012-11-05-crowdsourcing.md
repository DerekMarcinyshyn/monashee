I recently began working on a plugin for WordPress which attempts to help solve issues and hopefully in the process create solutions to problems. We have been testing many of the popular ways people on the internet communicate. The most popular way is through comments. Essentially, Facebook is one big comment forum. Users post their status and their friends can like it or if they want to add to it, they type in a comment.

On popular news sites, such as CBC, CTV, or Yahoo!, there are no rules and no real names associated with the likes and comments. Anonymity rules the wide open internet, which for most cases is the way it should be. These sites do not offer much in terms of solving issues or gathering any statistical representation of what is being said other than some entertainment value. 

When it comes to government and business we all would like to see the world move forward for the better and have everyone’s ideas heard. The plugin we are developing will create an easy way to brainstorm ideas and let users communicate their ideas. We are planning on using the concept of crowdsourcing.

Crowdsourcing is a distributed problem-solving and production model. In the classic use of the term, problems are broadcast to an unknown group of solvers in the form of an open call for solutions. Users—also known as the crowd—submit solutions. Solutions are then owned by the entity that broadcast the problem in the first place—the crowdsourcer. The contributor of the solution is, in some cases, compensated either monetarily, with prizes, or with recognition. In other cases, the only rewards may be kudos or intellectual satisfaction. Crowdsourcing may produce solutions from amateurs or volunteers working in their spare time, or from experts or small businesses which were unknown to the initiating organization.
