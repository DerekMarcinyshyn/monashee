##Introduction

As our lives become increasingly digital, many of us share more and more on social media sites.

Consequently, employers and colleges have started to request access to our personal profiles as a way to learn more about us.

Should the same standards of privacy we've come to expect offline apply online, too? Take a look.

##The Situation

Many HR managers review publicly available social media profiles. One survey said 75% of recruiters reported policies that required online research of applications.

However, some folks have made their social media profiles private, which prevents managers from viewing their accounts.

Consequently, some employers are asking for access to applicants' private profiles so they can view them.

Nearly all applicants agree to this voluntary review, because they need or want the job.

##Who's Asking for Access

###Colleges and Universities
Some colleges are requiring student-atheletes to "friend" a coach or administrator who can monitor their account. 

###Police Departments
Some departments ask applicants to sign into their social media profiles to be screened.

###Correctional Facilities
Facilities that have asked for login information claim they do so to make sure applicants don't have ties to gangs.

###911 Dispatchers
Some applicants are asked to "friend" background investigators on social sites as a part of of the screening process.

###Public Agencies
Public agencies more often request usernames and passwords from applicants than others.
